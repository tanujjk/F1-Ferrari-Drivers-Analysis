# Two Drivers, One Seat: The Ferrari Dilemma

With Lewis Hamilton, a seven-time veteran Formula One driver, making a historic switch to the Ferrari F1 team, I embarked on this project to visualize and compare the statistics of current Ferrari drivers, Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, aiming to assess whether Ferrari made the right decision in letting Carlos Sainz go.

This project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning, preparation, and visualization techniques, utilizing tools such as pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## Project Highlights:
- **Data Visualization**: The project features visually appealing and easy-to-read charts:
  - **Density Plot**: Compares the fastest lap times of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc against Lewis Hamilton. This chart visualizes the lap time density curve and spread.
  - **Box Plot**: Displays the fastest lap times of Carlos Sainz, Lewis Hamilton, and Charles Leclerc. Given the narrow time differences between the drivers, the box plot provides a clear visualization of the distribution.
  - **Line Plot**: Illustrates the average fastest lap times of each driver from 2018 to 2022, enabling a visualization of the drivers' improvement over the years.
  - **Histogram**: Shows the qualifying placement distribution for each driver, indicating their likelihood of securing a top position in a Grand Prix race.
  - **Bar Chart**: Represents the points collected by each driver during their tenure with the Ferrari F1 team.

## Learning Opportunity:
This project served as a valuable learning opportunity for developing data visualization techniques in Python. Through this endeavor, I honed my skills in interpreting and presenting data effectively, contributing to a deeper understanding of the sport and its intricacies.
